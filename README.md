# HersheyView
This code is Java implementation of a program to render and display the [Hershey Vector fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts) developed c. 1967 by [Dr. Allen Vincent Hershey](http://iagenweb.org/boards/jefferson/obituaries/index.cgi?read=56609) at the Naval Weapons Laboratory.  The code parses the fonts from a compact, text-based format beleived to have been developed by James Hurt of Cognition, Inc.

I originally created HersheyView as a tool to support the developoment of a set of vector fonts for my [LaserCut program](https://github.com/wholder/LaserCut) (still in development), but decided to publish it here to help draw attention to this pioneering work by Dr. Hershey.  His work formed the basis of modern, digital typography, but is today nearly forgotten.  For more information about Dr. Hershey's fonts, see the article "[Reviving the Hershey fonts](https://lwn.net/Articles/654819/)" by Adobe's [Frank GrieÃŸhammer](https://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-designers/frank-griesshammer.html) (from a presentation at [TypeCon](http://www.typecon.com/) 2015, in Denver CO.)  A [video by the same author](https://vimeo.com/178015110) presents more information about the development of the fonts by Dr. Hershey as well as photos and background information on his life and career.

### Features
 - Click the "**`Show Origin`**" checkbox to display the origin of the vectors that make up each character glyph.
 - Click the "**`Show Grid`**" checkbox to display a unit grid
 - Click the "**`Show L/R`**" checkbox to display red, vertical lines that show left and right boundaries of the glyph.
 - Use the dropdown to select a zoom factor of 8 to 64 times.
 - Click the "**`Show Vectors`**" button to display a list of all the vectors (x1, y1, x2, y2) used to draw the glyph.
 - Click the "**`Find Glyph`**" button to get a popup menu where you can select a specific glyph from the different font families available.
 - Use the slider and the left/right arrows under the view area to select a glyph.  While the slider is selected, the left/right arrow keys will also control it.

Each glyph is assigned a code that's displayed in the upper left corner of the view area.  This code is unique to Dr. Hershey's fonts and does not correspond to standard ASCII, or any other character coding scheme.  However, the characters needed to build a set of ASCII characters is available in the set of glyphs and, using a set of lookup tables, the code will display the ASCII code for a glyph (it it exists) as well as the name of font family, which includes:

 - Cyrillic Complex
 - Gothic English Triplex
 - Gothic German Triplex
 - Gothic Italian Triplex
 - Greek Complex
 - Greek Complex Small
 - Greek Plain
 - Greek Simplex
 - Italic Complex
 - Italic Complex Small
 - Italic Triplex
 - Roman Complex
 - Roman Complex Small
 - Roman Duplex
 - Roman Plain
 - Roman Simplex
 - Roman Triplex
 - Script Complex
 - Script Simplex
 
Note: There are also a wide variety of specialized symbnols included that do not have ASCII equivalents.   In addition, Dr. Hershey also developed a Japanese character font, but those glyphs are not included in the code.
### Requirements
Java 8 JDK, or later must be installed in order to compile the code.  There is also a [**Runnable JAR file**](https://github.com/wholder/HersheyView/tree/master/out/artifacts/HersheyView_jar) included in the checked in code that you can download.   On a Mac, just double click the `GerberPlot.jar` file and it should start.  Then, use `File->Open Gerber File` to open a file and then use the `Options` menu to select different render modes.  _Note: you may have to select the `GerberPlot.jar` file, then do a right click and select "Open" the first time you run the file to satisfy Mac OS' security checks._  You should also be able to run the JAR file on Windows or Linux systems, but you'll need to have a Java 8 JRE, or later installed and follow the appropriate process for each needed to run an executable JAR file.
