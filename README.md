# HersheyView
This code is Java implementation of a program to render and display the [Hershey Vector fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_fonts) developed c. 1967 by Dr. Allen Vincent Hershey at the Naval Weapons Laboratory.  The code parses the fonts from a compact, text-based format beleived to have been developed by James Hurt at Cognition, Inc.

### Requirements
Java 8 JDK, or later must be installed in order to compile the code.  There is also a [**Runnable JAR file**](https://github.com/wholder/HersheyView/tree/master/out/artifacts/HersheyView_jar) included in the checked in code that you can download.   On a Mac, just double click the `GerberPlot.jar` file and it should start.  Then, use `File->Open Gerber File` to open a file and then use the `Options` menu to select different render modes.  _Note: you may have to select the `GerberPlot.jar` file, then do a right click and select "Open" the first time you run the file to satisfy Mac OS' security checks._  You should also be able to run the JAR file on Windows or Linux systems, but you'll need to have a Java 8 JRE, or later installed and follow the appropriate process for each needed to run an executable JAR file.
